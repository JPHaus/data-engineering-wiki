A medallion architecture is a data design pattern used to logically organize data in a lakehouse, with the goal of incrementally improving the quality of data as it flows through various layers. This architecture consists of three distinct layers – bronze (raw), silver (validated) and gold (enriched) – each representing progressively higher levels of quality.
