Cardinality has different meanings depending on the context of what's being discussed. In data engineering, we mainly use cardinality when talking about a data model's relationships and when talking about the statistics of a particular column in a database table.

## Cardinality (Data Modeling)

The number of rows in one table that relate to rows in another table. Common types include one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many. It's used to define and analyze relationships in data models.[^1]

## Cardinality (SQL Statements)

The number of distinct values in a column/expression. Low cardinality means many repeated values, while high cardinality means most values are unique.[^2] Database engines can use this information to optimize SQL queries.
