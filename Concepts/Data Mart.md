## Data Mart Advantages

- in general - better performance due to querying only a subset of data rather than a whole data warehouse, should also require less resources and maintenance than a monolith data warehouse.
- domain focus means data marts should be more flexible and grant bigger user empowerment and encouragement.
## Data Mart Disadvantages

- data quality risk - the risk of arising discrepancies between a data mart and the original data warehouse.
- implementation challenges - poor design may lead to extensive complexity and inconsistencies over time.
