The event sourcing pattern captures all changes to an application as a sequence of event objects. This pattern creates a ledger of changes that can be used to replay events and view application state at any point in time.

## Event Sourcing Pattern Advantages

- Provides an audit trail which is useful for auditing and compliance.
- You can rebuild the state of any entity to any point in time by replaying events.
- Aligns well with event-driven architectures and microservices where services communicate via events.

## Event Sourcing Pattern Disadvantages

- Managing the event store can be complex as the number of events grow and schema changes happen.
- Leads to an eventually consistent system (which is fine if that's acceptable) but should be noted it can introduce latency.
- Rebuilding an entity's current state by replaying all past events can resource intensive. Snapshotting can help mitigate this.
