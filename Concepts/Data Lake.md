A data lake is a flexible storage pattern that is typically used for storing massive amounts of raw data in its native format.[^1] Data lakes are flexible in that they can store practically any type of data from structured (tabular data), semi-structured (JSON, XML), and unstructured data (videos, images, audio). Data lakes utilize blob storage which is a cheap and abundant and a compute engine of the user's choice.

## Data Lake Advantages

- Cheaply store large amounts of data.
- Flexibly store any type of data (futureproof).
- Allows for compute optimization by mixing and matching compute options for different workloads.
- All data is stored in one place where all stakeholders can work.

## Data Lake Disadvantages

- Data governance is more challenging and relies on robust cataloging and metadata to make the data useful. Cloud providers often offer additional services to address these issues.
- Because storage is cheap, there's a tendency to store more data regardless of it's business value.
