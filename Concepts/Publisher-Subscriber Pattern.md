The Publisher-Subscriber pattern is an asynchronous messaging pattern that decouples sending events to one or more subscribers/consumers of those events. [^1]

## Publisher-Subscriber Pattern Advantages

- Decouples software and improves scalability due to async sending and ability to scale different parts of the system independently. [^2]
- Push-based delivery reduces latency and eliminates the need for polling.
- Simplifies integration code between systems.

## Publisher-Subscriber Pattern Disadvantages

- Message ordering isn't guaranteed and messages may be duplicated. Must design system to be [[Idempotence|idempotent]].
- Subscribers may need the ability to autoscale to keep up with the rate of messages.
