Data Modeling is the process of mapping out an information system and how multiple parts are connected. Data models are typically illustrated in an entity-relationship diagram for relational databases like the picture below.

## Benefits of data modeling
Data modeling makes it easier for developers and other stakeholders to view and understand the relationships between data in a database or data warehouse. A good data model can also have the following benefits:
- Reduce errors in software and database development.
- Increase consistency in documentation and system design across the enterprise.
- Improve application and database performance.
- Ease data mapping throughout the organization.
- Improve communication between developers and business intelligence teams.
- Ease and speed the process of database design at the conceptual, logical and physical levels.
