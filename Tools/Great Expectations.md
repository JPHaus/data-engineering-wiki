[Great Expectations](https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations) is a [[Python]] library for creating [[Data Unit Test|data unit tests]] that can be used in your [[Data Pipeline|data pipelines]].

# Workflow
1) Introduce the expectation early into the process, perhaps even before you've built a pipeline.
2) Show it to the stakeholder and have them validate the assumptions.
3) Implement it into your pipeline.
4) Continuously update tests as data changes by iterating with the stakeholder.
