[dlt](https://pypi.org/project/dlt/) is an open-source library that enables you to create a data pipeline in a Python script, replacing your glue code with robust, declarative 1-liners with schema evolution. dlt is the first Python library in this space, enabling you to run pipelines anywhere python runs - no redundant orchestrators, etc.
