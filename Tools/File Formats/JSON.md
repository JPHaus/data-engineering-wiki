JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write, and for machines to parse and generate. JSON is a text-based format that uses curly braces ({}) to indicate objects, brackets ([]) to indicate arrays, and quotes ("") around string values. It is often used when transferring data in APIs.

**Extension:** `.json`

## JSON Advantages

- Human readable/writeable.
- Supports several data types (string, number, object, array, true/false, and null) and nested data structures.
- Flexible schema evolution.

## JSON Disadvantages

- Must read the entire file - can't read line-by-line
- Not compressed
- Doesn't support binary data

There are other versions of JSON that address some of these disadvantages (see BSON and NDJSON.)
