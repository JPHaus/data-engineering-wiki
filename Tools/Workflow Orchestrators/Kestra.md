[Kestra](https://github.com/kestra-io/kestra) is a universal open-source orchestrator that makes both **scheduled** and **event-driven** workflows easy. By bringing **Infrastructure as Code** best practices to data, process, and microservice orchestration, you can build reliable workflows and manage them with confidence.

In just a few lines of code, you can create a flow directly from the UI. Thanks to the declarative YAML interface for defining orchestration logic, business stakeholders can participate in the workflow creation process.

Kestra offers a versatile set of **language-agnostic** developer tools while simultaneously providing an intuitive user interface tailored for business professionals. The YAML definition gets automatically adjusted any time you make changes to a workflow from the UI or via an API call. Therefore, the orchestration logic is always managed **declaratively in code**, even if some workflow components are modified in other ways (UI, CI/CD, Terraform, API calls).
