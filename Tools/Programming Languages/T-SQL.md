[T-SQL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-reference?view=sql-server-ver15) is Microsoft's proprietary version of the SQL standard which is used to interact with the [[Microsoft SQL Server]] database. T-SQL expands on SQL to include [procedural programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming), local variables, various support functions for string processing, date processing, mathematics, etc. and changes to the **DELETE** and **UPDATE** statements.
