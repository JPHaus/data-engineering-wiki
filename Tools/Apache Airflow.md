[Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) is an open-source platform used to programmatically develop, schedule, and orchestrate [[Batch Data Processing|batch workflows]]. It is most commonly used to schedule Python and SQL scripts but is flexible enough to schedule any other type of script you might use to build your data pipeline. There are also several companies that offer [Airflow as a service](https://airflow.apache.org/ecosystem/#airflow-as-a-service) if you don't want to manage the infrastructure yourself.
